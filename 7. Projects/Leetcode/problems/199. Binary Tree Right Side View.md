> [!NOTE]
> This problem is not very difficult as long as we're familiar with how tree nodes work.  
> The goal is to return the rightmost node from each level of the binary tree.  
> To solve this, we can perform a **level-order traversal** using a queue.  
> At each level, we process all the nodes and add the last node of that level to the result list.  
> To **keep track** of nodes at each level, we use a queue to store the current layer’s nodes.  
> For each node, we enqueue its left child first, then its right child.  
> Before processing each level, we record the size of the queue, so we only process nodes that belong to the current level.  
> After processing all levels, we return the result list.

錯在沒有檢查初始條件，root == None

這題第一時間是想到用上一題的結構 [[102. Binary Tree Level Order Traversal]] 來解。在leetcode上跑看似空間用的比較多。

看解答，也有dfs的解法，不確定會不會空間比較少。
