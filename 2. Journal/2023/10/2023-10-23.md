> [!Quote]+ Quote of the Day
> > Love is like a friendship caught on fire. In the beginning a flame, very pretty, often hot and fierce, but still only light and flickering. As love grows older, our hearts mature and our love becomes as coals, deep-burning and unquenchable.
> — <cite>Bruce Lee</cite>
